Since its isolation by Novoselov and Geim, graphene, a monolayer of carbon atoms, has attracted immense attention due to its exceptional characteristics. Although its applications are promising, the critical challenge lies in scaling up its production. Current methods like solution-processed exfoliation are yet to yield fully separated and stable graphene sheets. Consequently, establishing a rapid, standardized, and reliable characterization method for large-scale solution-processed graphene is crucial to enhance the production process.

Graphene flake size significantly influences its properties, with size variations affecting the balance of edge to bulk atoms and thereby its electrical and mechanical properties. Despite improvements in analytical techniques, determining the size distribution of graphene flakes remains challenging due to difficulties in visualizing these thin structures and partially unknown properties when characterizing the material.

My study focuses on developing a method for identifying graphene flakes using microscopic techniques. The methods discussed—including imaging, spectroscopy, and data analysis—provide a foundation for advancements in computer vision, automated optical inspection, and big data analytics for two-dimensional material fabrication.
