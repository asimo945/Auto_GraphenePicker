Graphene, the one atomic layer thick building-block in graphite, has gained enormous interest since Novoselov and Geim showed practically its isolation under ambient conditions and its unique properties. While promising applications are being discussed, the main challenge is to develop a practicable large-scale production process. Methods such as solution-processed exfoliation have the potential to achieve large-scale graphene production, but these approaches do not yet produce completely delaminated and stabilised graphene [1]â€“[3]. To monitor and optimise the graphene production process, development of a fast, standardised and reliable characterisation protocol for large-scale solution-processed graphene is therefore desirable [4], [5]. Among many characteristics of graphene flakes, lateral size is one of the most important factors that affects the various properties of graphene. Variation in size and geometry causes a change in ratio between edge and bulk structures, resulting in spatial confinement in specific dimensions that alters the electrical and mechanical behaviour [6], [7]. Although analytical techniques have continuously improved, methods to obtain the lateral size distribution of solution-processed graphene are limited. This is owing to the difficulties of visualising the ultra-thin nano-flakes and the fact that many of the properties of graphene are, de facto, still unknown if they are to be used to identify the material.
